GUIDE: How to create a simple HTML Project on Eclipse EE for Tomcat server

Installation guide of Java EE and Apache Tomcat 8.0 not included.

1. File > New > Dynamic Web project

	Target runtime > Your version of Tomcat you're running
	Latest Dynamic web module version
	Default configuration for Apache Tomcat
	
2. You'll now have a folder of the name you inputted with the following options:

	2a. Deployment Descriptor: <your project name>
		Everything here lets the server know everything about your server. More information later . . .
	2b. JAX-WS Web Services
		Don't worry about this one.
	2c. Java Resources
		Where you'll be doing anything java related here. Mainly servlets go here as well.
	2d. Javascript Resources
		Javascript files, if you have any.
	2e. build
		Don't worry about this one.
	2f. Webcontent
		Where your HTML, and subsequently, the heart of your web pages goes here. There are two important folders to guide the server:
		2g. META-INF
			This folder helps name the path you would like for your webcontent [e.g localhost8080:yourpath], this will be important.
		2h. WEB-INF
			This folder helps determine the server where to go for particular items in the context of your web page.
		
3. Right click Webcontent > New > New HTML File
	Let's name this test.html.
	For the title, let's leave it as a simple Hello World! and save the file.
	
4. Right Click your new project > Profile as... > Profile on Server > Select Tomcat Server, click next > Add your project to the configured side, if it isn't already.

Eclipse will now load a new tab that will have the address http://localhost:8080/<your project here>/. 
You can type the same address into the address bar of your browser and it will also work.
